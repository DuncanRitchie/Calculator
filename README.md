# Duncan’s Calculator (React)

⚛️ My first project in React, created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

🚀 [Online demo](https://www.duncanritchie.co.uk/calculator/).

🧮 In November 2019, I made an [executable version](https://github.com/DuncanRitchie2/CalculatorWinforms "Executable version of Duncan’s calculator") with C# and Windows Forms.
